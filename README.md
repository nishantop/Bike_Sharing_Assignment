## General Information
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. You will need to submit a Jupyter notebook for the same.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- We got at a very best fitted model for the the demand of shared bike.
- We observed that temperature attribute cofficient is in the higher side.
- Boom bikes should focus on temprature attribute,but due to Covid pandemic we can see fall in the revenue.
- Boom bikes should focus in Summer season especially on weekends because demand will be high that time.
- In Spring season the cofficient is less, So Boom bikes can provide more offers to increase the demand.
